## Hi, I am [Celestial紗雪](https://github.com/CelestialSayuki)

> Leaving the branch of the magic Integration Association, I went abroad immediately.
There is a small flower beside the gate of the country.
The stem grows straight out of the ground, with bright red flowers at the front.
Higanbana.
The flowers that can be seen everywhere poke their heads out from the cracks of the floor tiles laid on the ground and swing in the wind.
Every time I see this flower, I will remember it.
Lonely, but more beautiful than anyone
